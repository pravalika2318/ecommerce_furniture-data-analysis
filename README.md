# Conclusion
After evaluating the models, we can conclude which model performed better and
further tune hyperparameters if needed. Random Forest tends to perform better on
complex datasets with high variance, while Linear Regression might work well if
relationships are linear.
# Output:
1. Linear Regression Model: MSE and R-squared score.
2. Random Forest Model: MSE and R-squared score
